Frame/pixel-level discrepancies
=========================
Elroy only kicks in on the next tile rather than instantaneously.  
Pinky/Blinky's house spot is one pixel to the right for some bizarre reason wtf
They turn right like a frame or two too late after leaving the pen, I think
Death animation possibly not frame-perfect
