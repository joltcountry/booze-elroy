BUGS?
-------
YOU CAN STILL EAT TWO GHOSTS AT THE SAME GODDAMN TIME.  FUCK.  The ghosts have to be at the exact same pixel
if all ghosts are dead, turn off frightened?  Check that
dead eye speed
game over should not make fruit disappear

Occasionally laggy

OPTIONS?

Frame/pixel-level discrepancies
=========================
Elroy only kicks in on the next tile rather than instantaneously.  
Pinky/Blinky's house spot is one pixel to the right for some bizarre reason wtf
They turn right like a frame or two too late after leaving the pen, I think
Death animation possibly not frame-perfect
