BUGS?
-------
YOU CAN STILL EAT TWO GHOSTS AT THE SAME GODDAMN TIME.  FUCK.  The ghosts have to be at the exact same pixel
Check sounds when coming out of frightened, with a dead ghost on the screen. -- Possibly beef's issue
Occasionally laggy
game over should not make fruit disappear
dead eye speed
if all ghosts are dead, turn off frightened?  Check that

700 score didn't go away, check png -- I think I fixed this
Sounds went batshit insane after 700 bug maybe?!?!
  

1000 sprite all fucked up

OPTIONS?

Frame/pixel-level discrepancies
=========================
Elroy only kicks in on the next tile rather than instantaneously.  
Pinky/Blinky's house spot is one pixel to the right for some bizarre reason wtf
They turn right like a frame or two too late after leaving the pen, I think
Death animation possibly not frame-perfect
